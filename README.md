# eliteteam_logger_app
Full implementation of the send logger for the elite team

Uses PHP to talk to database currently, but I want to use the JavaScript API in the RESTful folder instead.

index.php and showdata.php are the two main pages, index is the logger and showdata is the lookup page. Index.php uses connect.php to talk to database.
download.php was supposed to be the download data function.
